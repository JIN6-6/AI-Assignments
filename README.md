### 1. [Linear Regression: Predicting Seoul Apartment Prices](./assignment1-linear-regression/) 
- **Description**: A project to implement a simple linear regression model using PyTorch. The model was trained on a synthetic dataset generated based on real-world market statistics to analyze the relationship between apartment size and price.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Model implementation with `nn.Linear`
  - MSE Loss and SGD Optimization
  - Learning rate tuning for scaled input data
  - Result visualization with Matplotlib
- **Status**: `Completed`
